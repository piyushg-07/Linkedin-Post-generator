ERROR:root:Error processing post: So when I left a toxic work environment, I told my manager a simple thing and felt so good \U0001f62f

I just said-

'Hope your son gets a manager like you.
I hope that the manager behaves the same way as you did with me.
Thank you.'

Now tell me 1 thing-

She always said that she was a great manager.
Why will she get offended?

I just told her that I wish her son would get a manager like she was.

If you felt bad, then that means you were a bad manager and now you know it. \ud83e80

If you feel good, then take it as a blessing for your son and you'll really want someone to treat your son/daughter in the same way.

She cannot be even angry with me else it'll prove that she was not a 'great' manager.

Hope you all become the people that your sons/daughters will like to work under \U0001f64f

There are a lot of bad people/things, bring a small change and break the chain :)
